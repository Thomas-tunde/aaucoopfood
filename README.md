##  Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thomas‑tunde/aaucoopfood.git

2. **Set up a local PHP server**

   * Using PHP’s built‑in server:

     ```bash

     ```

   * Or use a tool like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP—place the project folder in your server’s document root.

4. **Ordering flow**

   * Navigate through menu items
   * Add to cart
   * “Place Order”—tests form submission to PHP scripts (mock functionality)

* Payment integration (e.g., Paystack, Stripe)
* Admin interface for inventory control
* Validation and security enhancements (input sanitization, CSRF protection)
